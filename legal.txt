DISCLAIMER While performing OSINT is legal, using the OSINT tools and techniques outlined in this website are intended to be used in conjunction with sanctioned Red Team activities
as part of a contracted service with the permission of the target. When conducting any form of security testing, [IWTCT] strongly suggests only engaging in activities, including basic scope and OSINT,
after securing a fully executed engagement contract. Best practices may vary per jurisdiction, however at a minimum this countract should outline exactly what the target is, what you are permitted to
attempt to do, and when, along with acceptance criteria and remuneration. Do not take this lightly. The laws are changing rapidly, and the best way to prevent fines and/or imprisonment,
as well as to protect your future ability to perform such work, is to make absolutely sure you are providing a contracted service.
